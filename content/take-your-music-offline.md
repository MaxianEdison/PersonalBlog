I don't use [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify) or any other streaming platform for listening to music. Some call it old habits, some call it needless effort, but I'm very used to downloading [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) files over the internet and putting them in a folder on my phone then using the whatever default media player I have installed. However, for a couple of years, I have been following a better and automated approach for taking my music offline and feeling a bit less like I'm in a [consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism) bubble.

<!-- more -->

While I'm working, I usually have [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) open on one tab playing music. So I created a separate YouTube account/channel dedicated to creating playlists. In my workflow, after saving what I listen to a playlist, the next step would be downloading these tracks as MP3 and transferring them to my phone. But before I dive into details about how I'm doing that, there are some questions that I would like to answer.

**Q:** If you already have your music on YouTube, why not use YouTube on your phone?  
**A:** I would like to be able to listen to music when I'm offline (i.e. when there is no internet connection).

**Q:** Have you heard of [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/)?  
**A:** Yes, is it free?

**Q:** But YouTube is full of ads, isn't it annoying?  
**A:** I have an AdBlock extension.

**Q:** You are using YouTube at the end of the day. Doesn't it conflict with what you are trying to achieve while saying "move away from streaming platforms"?  
**A:** Yes, it is partially true. But I would like to discover new artists/music so I need a "source" for that. I'm only taking the good parts of YouTube (e.g. its algorithm) and self-hosting the rest.

**Q:** What about supporting the artists?  
**A:** Streaming is not the only way to support an artist.

**Q:** Why are you doing this?  
**A:** I would like to keep the hard copy of the media that I want to _consume_. I don't want to leave everything to "the cloud" and I find that wrong. Also, in some cases, I have witnessed the removal of the music that I like since I follow rather obscure artists. Plus, having physical files is great for collecting/archiving purposes. TL;DR: I love files.

**Q:** Is this a meme?  
**A:** No, check out ["Boomer Yells at Cloud Computing" by Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWaWt9d3yw0).

### Overview

1. Create playlists on YouTube
2. Download MP3 from YouTube periodically
3. Synchronize the MP3 files over to your phone
4. Use an open source MP3 player to listen to music

### Things that you need

- A home server (base of operations)
  - I have a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) running [Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/)
- An external drive (for storing MP3 files)
  - I have a 2.5" external hard disk drive with 1TB of storage connected to my Raspberry Pi
- A YouTube account (for creating playlists)
- [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)) (for downloading playlists)
- [Syncopoli](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.amoradi.syncopoli/) ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fengshaun/syncopoli)) (for `rsync`'ing MP3 files to an [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) phone)
- [Music Player GO](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.iven.musicplayergo/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/enricocid/Music-Player-GO)) (for actually listening to music)

#### Setting up the storage

<img src="/raspberry-pi.jpg" style="width: 50%" alt="Raspberry Pi"/><br>

In my case, I just connected my external hard drive to Raspberry Pi and updated `/etc/fstab` to mount it on boot.

```ini
# Static information about the filesystems.
# See fstab(5) for details.

# <file system> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
/dev/sda1       /mnt/tera exfat rw,user,uid=1000,umask=007,exec 0 0
```

So it will be mounted to `/mnt/tera` on boot. Note that I have `HPFS/NTFS/exFAT` filesystem on this drive and your situation might be different.

Next step is creating a separate directory on this drive (since I have some other files) and symlinking it to somewhere more convenient.

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/tera/backups/YouTube/
ln -s /mnt/tera/backups/ /backups
```

So that I will be able to use `/backups` as a directory pointing to my backups in the drive. Later on, I will be downloading the MP3 files to `/backups/YouTube` directory.

#### Creating a YouTube account

I like having things separated so I suggest having a YouTube channel just for creating playlists. You can create these playlists as public or private since `youtube-dl` supports both. You can use [`--cookies`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl) argument for specifying a cookie if needed.

Then you can start creating playlists as you are discovering new music/artists thanks to the great algorithm of YouTube!

![YouTube Playlists](/youtube-playlists.png)

#### Downloading playlists

In order to keep track of the downloaded videos (tracks), we will need to use [`download-archive`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-download-only-new-videos-from-a-playlist) feature of `youtube-dl`.

> With this feature you should initially download the complete playlist with --download-archive /path/to/download/archive/file.txt that will record identifiers of all the videos in a special file. Each subsequent run with the same --download-archive will download only new videos and skip all videos that have been downloaded before. Note that only successful downloads are recorded in the file.

So running the following command will suffice our needs and download the each playlist in their designated folder:

```sh
$ youtube-dl \
    --socket-timeout 15 \
    --ignore-errors \
    --extract-audio \
    --audio-format mp3 \
    --download-archive ".archive" \
    --output '%(playlist)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s' \
    "https://www.youtube.com/channel/<channel_id>/playlists"
```

Each directory will contain the MP3 files from that playlist:

```sh
$ ls patapon/ sonic/

patapon/:
"09. Moudamepon's Theme - Disk 2 - Patapon Complete Soundtrack.mp3"
'Patapon Soundtrack - 10 ビビリッチのテーマ.mp3'

sonic/:
'Burning Depths - Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed [OST].mp3'
'Disquieting Shadow - Sonic Heroes [OST].mp3'
```

List of video IDs will be stored in `.archive`:

```sh
youtube Hcrkbtcjoi4
youtube Hn1vLFDm98I
youtube _pUL7u-mYqA
...
```

Also, I wanted to keep track of what I have added to this list so I've used a git repository. Here is the final script:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

cd /backups/YouTube/

youtube-dl \
    --socket-timeout 15 \
    --ignore-errors \
    --extract-audio \
    --audio-format mp3 \
    --download-archive ".archive" \
    --output '%(playlist)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s' \
    "https://www.youtube.com/channel/<channel_id>/playlists"

git add .archive

git -c user.name="ytdl" \
    -c user.email="ytdl@git" \
    commit -m "upd: v$(date +'%s')"
```

#### Setting up the cronjob

Now we will need to create a [cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for periodically downloading the playlists using the previous script.

```sh
$ crontab -e # edit user's crontab

$ crontab -l # list cronjobs
0 0 * * 0 /backups/YouTube/fetch.sh
```

This cronjob will run [weekly](https://crontab.guru/#0_0_*_*_0) and download the playlists.

Here is what `git log` will look like after you let it run for a couple of weeks:

```

#### Syncing the files

I'm using [Syncopoli](https://gitlab.com/fengshaun/syncopoli) to [rsync(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) files over to my phone. It is a really simple yet effective application. Some parts are still WIP but you can head to the [repository](https://gitlab.com/fengshaun/syncopoli) and contribute if you're interested.

Main screen:

<img src="/syncopoli_main_screen.jpg" style="width: 50%" alt="Syncopoli main screen"/>

Settings:

<img src="/syncopoli_settings.jpg" style="width: 50%" alt="Syncopoli settings"/>

I had a couple of issues with my settings so it is always a good idea to monitor the SSH connection attempts on your server while trying out `Syncopoli`:

```sh
$ journalctl -f -u sshd
```

In my case, this command greatly helped me to spot issues like the following:

> fatal: Timeout before authentication for 192.168.1.37 port 60044

> error: maximum authentication attempts exceeded for orhun from 192.168.1.37 port 60038 ssh2 [preauth]

Also, you can use [Logcat Reader](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.dp.logcatapp/) to see which `rsync` commands are being run and what has failed.

<img src="/syncopoli_logcat_reader.jpg" style="width: 60%" alt="Logcat Reader"/>

For me, the biggest challenge was to use my private key for the SSH connection. To do that, you [need to](https://gitlab.com/fengshaun/syncopoli#ssh-key) convert your key to [dropbear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbear_(software)) format:

```sh
$ dropbearconvert openssh dropbear <openssh_private_key> <dropbear_output_file>
```

But even though I did this, I still couldn't connect:

> userauth_pubkey: signature algorithm ssh-rsa not in PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms [preauth]

I solved this issue by adding the following line to my `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and restarting `sshd`:

```
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa
```

Then everything worked perfectly and I managed to transfer files to my phone.

<img src="/syncopoli_transfer.jpg" style="width: 50%" alt="Syncopoli transfer"/><br>

Here is what my sync profile looks like:

<img src="/syncopoli_profile.jpg" style="width: 50%" alt="Syncopoli profile"/><br>

JSON export:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "globals": {
    "pref_key_server_address": "<server>",
    "pref_key_protocol": "SSH",
    "pref_key_username": "orhun",
    "pref_key_rsync_password": "",
    "pref_key_options": "-vrlt --no-perms",
    "pref_key_private_key": "/sdcard/alarm_dropbear.sec",
    "pref_key_port": "<port>",
    "pref_key_frequency": "12",
    "pref_key_ssh_password": "",
    "pref_key_wifi_only": true,
    "pref_key_wifi_name": "",
    "pref_key_as_root": ""
  },
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "Sync Music",
      "sources": [
        "../../backups/YouTube/"
      ],
      "destination": "/sdcard/Music/YouTube/",
      "rsync_options": "-zhPu --exclude \".git*\" --exclude \".archive\" --exclude \"*.sh\"",
      "direction": "INCOMING"
    }
  ]
}
```

I had to use `../../` for the origin directory since `rsync` is launched from `$HOME` as default. Maybe there is another way to achieve this but this worked well so I didn't look into other options. If you know a better way, let me know!

#### Tweaking rsync settings

The default arguments that are passed to `rsync` are the following:

- `--verbose, -v`: increase verbosity
- `--recursive, -r`: recurse into directories
- `--links, -l`: copy symlinks as symlinks
- `-times, -t`: preserve modification times
- `--no-perms`: do not preserve permissions

Additionally, I'm using the following flags/arguments:

- `--compress, -z`: compress file data during the transfer
- `--human-readable, -h`: output numbers in a human-readable format
- `-P`: equivalent to `--partial --progress`. Its purpose is to make it much easier to specify these two options for a long transfer that may be interrupted.
- `--update, -u`: skip files that are newer on the receiver
- `--exclude=PATTERN`: exclude files matching PATTERN

Keep in mind that you can use `--dry-run, -n` flag to perform a trial run. It is also a good idea to create another profile on `Syncopoli` for dry-run.

I also suggest having albums and long mixes in a separate playlist so that you can `--exclude` them with `rsync` to avoid long download times.

#### Listening to music 🎶

After going through all these steps and automating the download/sync process, there is one simple thing left to do: feed your soul with music via [Music Player GO](https://github.com/enricocid/Music-Player-GO)!

<img src="/music-player-go.jpg" style="width: 90%" alt="Music Player GO"/><br>

And there you have it, an alternative approach to how you can enjoy listening to music offline while actually owning _the data_.
